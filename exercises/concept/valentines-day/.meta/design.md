# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what [Algebraic Data Types][ADT] (ADT) are.
- Know how ADTs are different from enums.
- Know how to define ADT, with and without data.
- Know how to pattern match on ADTs using [case expressions][case-expression].

## Out of scope

- Recursive ADT.
- Single type wrapper ADT.
- Active patterns.
- Adding members to ADT.
- `function` pattern shorthand notation.

## Concepts

- `Algebraic Data Types`: know what ADTs are; know how ADTs are different from enums; know how to define an ADT, with and without data; know how to pattern match on ADTs.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: defining functions and scoping and using integers.
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching.
